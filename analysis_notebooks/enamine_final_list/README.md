The `Enamine Final List.ipynb` notebook processes `enamine_costs_clustered_v3_with_nneighbor.csv.gz` containing 5620 compounds that were filtered based on the top RF predictions and availability. The compounds are then filtered down from 5620 to 100 compounds. 

`enamine_costs_clustered_v3_with_nneighbor.csv.gz`: contains 5620 compounds that were filtered based on the top RF predictions and availability. This file also contains `TB_0.4 ID` column which is the clustering ID of Taylor-Butina clustering that was applied to Training+AMS(1024 cpds)+Enamine(5620 cpds) at 0.4 threshold.
