## Analysis Notebooks Descriptions

- **AS Frequent Hitters SMARTS**: runs the AlphaScreen frequent hitters filter from Schorpp et al 2014 on training, AMS, and Enamine-hit compounds.
- **CV Plots**: produces cross-validation (CV) stage result figures.
- **Process AMS Results**: processes and analyzes AMS inhibition screening results to produce hit/non-hit delineation, figures, molecular structures, similarity to training, and tables.
- **Process AMS Results - Descriptive Actives**: processes and analyzes AMS screening inhibition results to filter them into categories of activity (strong, weak, and normal). 
- **Process Enamine REAL Results**: processes and analyzes AMS screening results to produce hit/non-hit delineation, figures, molecular structures, similarity to training, and tables.
- **REAL DB RF vs SimBaseline Predictions**: compares the prediction scores of RandomForest and SimilarityBaseline on the Enamine REAL dataset. Focus is on seeing the overlap of percentage. 
- **Training vs AMS vs Enamine Hits**: produces distribution plots of the inhibition readings for the training, AMS screen, and Enamine screen datasets.
- **table4_enamine_68_cpds.tsv**: convenient tab-delimited table (without images) of the 68 screened Enamine compounds.
- **enamine_final_list**: subfolder containing notebooks and code for producing the list of purchased Enamine compounds. 
- **preliminary_notebooks**: subfolder containing production and secondary notebooks. Final versions are moved to this folder.
