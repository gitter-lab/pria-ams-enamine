## Analysis notebooks

- **enamine_final_list**: subdirectory containing notebooks and code for producing the list of purchased Enamine compounds. 
- **preliminary_notebooks**: subdirectory containing exploratory and secondary scripts and notebooks. Final versions were moved to this directory. 
- **AS Frequent Hitters SMARTS.ipynb**: runs the AlphaScreen frequent hitters filter from Schorpp et al. 2014 on training, AMS, and Enamine hit compounds.
- **CV Plots.ipynb**: produces cross-validation stage result figures.
- **Process AMS Results - Descriptive Actives.ipynb**: processes and analyzes AMS screening inhibition results to filter them into categories of activity (strong, weak, and normal). 
- **Process AMS Results.ipynb**: processes and analyzes AMS inhibition screening results to produce hit/non-hit delineation, figures, molecular structures, similarity to training, and tables.
- **Process Enamine REAL Results.ipynb**: processes and analyzes Enamine screening results to produce hit/non-hit delineation, figures, molecular structures, similarity to training, and tables.
- **REAL DB RF vs SimBaseline Predictions.ipynb**: compares the prediction scores of the Random Forest and Similarity Baseline on the Enamine REAL dataset. 
- **Training vs AMS vs Enamine Hits.ipynb**: produces distribution plots of the % inhibition readings for the training, AMS screen, and Enamine screen datasets.
- **table4_enamine_68_cpds.tsv**: machine-readable tab-delimited table (without images) of the 68 screened Enamine compounds.
